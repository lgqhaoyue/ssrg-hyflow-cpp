DSTM provides an alternative to classical lock-based distributed concurrency control for achieving concurrency in a networked environment.

\section{Thesis Organization}

The rest of the thesis is organized as follows: Chapter~\ref{chap:relWork} overviews past and related work in the DSTM space, and contrasts them with the thesis's problem space. Chapter~\ref{chap:progInterface} illustrates the programming model required to develop benchmarks in our framework. Chapter~\ref{chap:sysArch} describes our framework architecture and interaction between different components. Chapter~\ref{chap:algorithm} explains the TFA algorithm and its adoption in different transactional models.We report our experimental results in Chapter~\ref{chap:expResults}. Finally, we conclude the thesis in Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion}.

Related Work

Research in DSTM space have been relatively small and recent in comparison to STM. Manassiev~\cite{Manassiev:2006:EDV:1122971.1123002} work based on Distributed Multiversioning(DMV) can be considered one of first paper on DSTM published in 2006. It
exploited the distributed data versions in order to avoid read-write conflicts. Later,
...
For our discussion purpose we will divide the work in DSTM space in two parts:
1. Strong Memory Consistency
2. Weak Memory Consistency
